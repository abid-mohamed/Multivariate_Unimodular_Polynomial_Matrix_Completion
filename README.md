# Multivariate Unimodular Polynomial Matrix Completion 

Implementation using Maple of the multivariate unimodular polynomial matrix completion (Algorithme of Lombardi-Yengui) with applications to signal processing problems that requires solving a set of multinomial equations. 

The algorithm involves finding a Gr√∂bner basis that allows to transfer the problem into finding the solution of one-variable polynomial.
